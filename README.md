# modding this random game

so there may be a game out there called [another flappy 2048](https://hczhcz.github.io/Another-Flappy-2048/), which i can only assume was the result of pushing flappy bird and 2048 together really really hard.

but there's an interesting problem with it, at least for me: the static camera. for padding purposes, each "wall" has a duplicate of itself stacked on the top, which is important when they begin to scroll up and down. these padding cells are actually interactable even though they sit out of view and can give you score, although it's near impossible to judge where you are.

but fear not, for a magical wizard by the name of me has wasted a large chunk of their time on this very problem. with some math and suffering i made a bookmarklet that makes the camera follow you around, so its now possible to look up into the sky.

can you see it now? taste it. become a galaxy. youre immortal.
